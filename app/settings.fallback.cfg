# Turn lower body to movement direction. 'true' makes diagonal movement more realistic.

In this case we have to increment death counter and run disposed actor's script instantly.If this setting is false, player has to wait until end of death animation in all cases. Makes using of summoned creatures exploit (looting summoned Dremoras and Golden Saints for expensive weapons) a lot harder.

auto use object normal maps = true
# If this option is enabled, normal maps are automatically recognized and used if they are named appropriately (see 'normal map pattern', e.g. for a base texture foo.dds, the normal map texture would have to be named foo_n.dds).

exponential fog = true

radial fog = true
# By default, the fog becomes thicker proportionally to your distance from the clipping plane set at the clipping distance, which causes distortion at the edges of the screen.

[Navigator]
enable = true

May slightly affect performance on multi-core CPU systems. Multi-core CPU systems may have different latency for nav mesh update depending on other settings and system performance. Moving across external world, entering/exiting location produce nav mesh update. NPC and creatures may not be able to find path before nav mesh is built around them. Try to disable this if you want to have old fashioned AI which doesnâ€™t know where to go when you stand behind that stone and casting a firebolt.
